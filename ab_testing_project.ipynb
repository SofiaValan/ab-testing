    "# Audacity A/B Testing Project\n",
    "\n",
    "## Experiment Overview: Free Trial Screener\n",
    "\n",
    "Udacity is an online course platform specialized in IT sector. At the moment, they want to run an experiment on their website with the goal of improving the course completion rate of their students.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Context\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a more in-deepth look to how the Udacity environment is setup before the experiment:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Udacity courses currently have two options on the course overview page: \"Start Free Trial\", and \"Access Course Materials\".\n",
    "* If the student clicks \"Start Free Trial\" button, they will be asked to enter their credit card information, and then they will be enrolled in a free trial for the paid version of the course.\n",
    "* If the student clicks \"Access Course Materials\", they will be able to view the videos and take the quizzes for free, but they will not receive any bonuses, like coaching services or earning the certificate of the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description of the Experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "* In the experiment, Udacity tested a change where if the student clicked \"Start Free Trial\" button, they were asked how much time they had available to devote to the course. \n",
    "* If the student indicated 5 or more hours per week, they would be taken through the checkout process as usual. \n",
    "* If they indicated fewer than 5 hours per week, a message would appear indicating that Udacity courses usually require a greater time commitment for successful completion, and suggesting that the student might like to access the course materials for free. \n",
    "* At this point, the student would have the option to continue enrolling in the free trial, or access the course materials for free instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "The hypothesis was that this might set clearer expectations for students upfront, thus reducing the number of frustrated students who left the free trial because they didn't have enough time—without significantly reducing the number of students to continue past the free trial and eventually complete the course. If this hypothesis held true, Udacity could improve the overall student experience and improve coaches' capacity to support students who are likely to complete the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unit of Diversion\n",
    "\n",
    "The unit of diversion is a cookie, although if the student enrolls in the free trial, they are tracked by user-id from that point forward. The same user-id cannot enroll in the free trial twice. For users that do not enroll, their user-id is not tracked in the experiment, even if they were signed in when they visited the course overview page.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Experiment Design\n",
    "### Metric Choice\n",
    "\n",
    "The invariant metrics are the ones which shouldn't change across the experiment and the control group. These metrics work to perform a sanity check after running the experiment to test if there was any issue on the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation metrics are those target metrics that you expect to change across groups and are relevant for the business goals. For each metric, it is defined a $D_{min}$ which marks the minimum change which is practically significant to the business. This figure is provided by Udacity for each of the metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Invariant Metrics (Sanity Check)\n",
    "\n",
    "For this case, the following metrics will be chosen as invariant metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Number of cookies per course page by day. This metric has been chosen because in this case the number of cookies for each group should remain the same during the experiment. As cookies is our unit of diversion for this experiment, the sample size needs to be the same across both groups. It will be represented by $Cookies$ and it has a $D_{min} = 3,000$.\n",
    "  \n",
    "* Number of clicks in the 'Start Free Trial' button by day. As this click happens before the Free Trial Screener message appears, this metric shouldn't be impacted by the experiment. It should remain with no changes. It will be represented by $Clicks$ and it has a $D_{min} = 240$.\n",
    "  \n",
    "* Click-Through-Probability in the 'Start Free Trial' button by day. This metric is the relationship between the number of clicks on the 'Start Free Trial' button and the number of cookies on page. If these two metrics don't change, the CTP shouldn't change either. It will be represented by $\\frac{Clicks}{Cookies}$ and it has a $D_{min} = 0.01$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "The metrics that will be used as evaluation metrics are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Gross Conversion. This metric is the relationship between the number of user IDs to complete the checkout and enroll the free trial divided by unique cookie clicks on the button. It will be represented by $\\frac{User IDs enrolled}{Clicks}$ and it has a $D_{min} = 0.01$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Retention. This metric is the relationship between the number of user IDs to remain enrolled and make at least one payment divided by unique user IDs to complete the checkout. It will be represented by $\\frac{User IDs paid}{User IDs enrolled}$ and it has a $D_{min} = 0.01$.\n",
    "  \n",
    "* Net Conversion. This metric is the relationship between the number of user IDs to remain enrolled and make at least one payment divided by the number of unique cookie clicks on the button. It will be represented by $\\frac{User IDs paid}{Clicks}$ and it has a $D_{min} = 0.0075$.\n",
    "\n",
    "These three metrics are expected to change because they are measured after the Free Trial Screener message appears. Also, they are relevant for the business because they help to measure the low funnel performance and retention.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Measuring Standard Deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "Udacity provides the following rough estimates for these metrics, probably measured with a daily aggregation. This is the baseline for each of the metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Unique cookies to view course overview page per day: 40,000\n",
    "* Unique cookies to click \"Start free trial\" per day: 3,200\n",
    "* Enrollments per day: 660\n",
    "* Click-through-probability on \"Start free trial\": 0.08\n",
    "* Probability of enrolling, given click (Gross Conversion): 0.20625\n",
    "* Probability of payment, given enroll (Retention): 0.53\n",
    "* Probability of payment, given click (Net Conversion): 0.1093125\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we will need to calculate the standard deviation for each of the evaluation metrics. This step is very important to test if a metric has a great variability or it is more robust. On one hand, the most variant a metric is, the harder is to get significant results. In the other hand, if the metric is too robust, it is possible it's too insensitive to capture the statistically significant change. \n",
    "\n",
    "Udacity assumes a sample size of 5,000 cookies visiting the course overview page per day. As the previous data is based on baseline numbers, we will need to readjust the metrics to a sample size of 5,000 cookies."
