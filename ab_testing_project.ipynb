    "# Audacity A/B Testing Project\n",
    "\n",
    "## Experiment Overview: Free Trial Screener\n",
    "\n",
    "Udacity is an online course platform specialized in IT sector. At the moment, they want to run an experiment on their website with the goal of improving the course completion rate of their students.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Context\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a more in-deepth look to how the Udacity environment is setup before the experiment:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Udacity courses currently have two options on the course overview page: \"start free trial\", and \"access course materials\".\n",
    "* If the student clicks \"Start Free Trial\" button, they will be asked to enter their credit card information, and then they will be enrolled in a free trial for the paid version of the course.\n",
    "* If the student clicks \"Access Course Materials\", they will be able to view the videos and take the quizzes for free, but they will not receive any bonuses, like coaching services or earning the certificate of the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description of the Experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "* In the experiment, Udacity tested a change where if the student clicked \"Start Free Trial\" button, they were asked how much time they had available to devote to the course. * If the student indicated 5 or more hours per week, they would be taken through the checkout process as usual. \n",
    "* If they indicated fewer than 5 hours per week, a message would appear indicating that Udacity courses usually require a greater time commitment for successful completion, and suggesting that the student might like to access the course materials for free. \n",
    "* At this point, the student would have the option to continue enrolling in the free trial, or access the course materials for free instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "The hypothesis was that this might set clearer expectations for students upfront, thus reducing the number of frustrated students who left the free trial because they didn't have enough timeâ€”without significantly reducing the number of students to continue past the free trial and eventually complete the course. If this hypothesis held true, Udacity could improve the overall student experience and improve coaches' capacity to support students who are likely to complete the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unit of Diversion\n",
    "\n",
    "The unit of diversion is a cookie, although if the student enrolls in the free trial, they are tracked by user-id from that point forward. The same user-id cannot enroll in the free trial twice. For users that do not enroll, their user-id is not tracked in the experiment, even if they were signed in when they visited the course overview page.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Experiment Design\n",
    "### Metric Choice\n",
    "\n",
    "List which metrics you will use as invariant metrics and evaluation metrics here. (These should be the same metrics you chose in the \"Choosing Invariant Metrics\" and \"Choosing Evaluation Metrics\" quizzes.)\n",
    "\n",
    "For each metric, explain both why you did or did not use it as an invariant metric and why you did or did not use it as an evaluation metric. Also, state what results you will look for in your evaluation metrics in order to launch the experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Measuring Standard Deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "List the standard deviation of each of your evaluation metrics. (These should be the answers from the \"Calculating standard deviation\" quiz.)\n",
    "\n",
    "For each of your evaluation metrics, indicate whether you think the analytic estimate would be comparable to the the empirical variability, or whether you expect them to be different (in which case it might be worth doing an empirical estimate if there is time). Briefly give your reasoning in each case.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sizing\n",
    "#### Number of Samples vs. Power\n",
    "\n",
    "Indicate whether you will use the Bonferroni correction during your analysis phase, and give the number of pageviews you will need to power you experiment appropriately. (These should be the answers from the \"Calculating Number of Pageviews\" quiz.)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Duration vs. Exposure\n",
    "\n",
    "Indicate what fraction of traffic you would divert to this experiment and, given this, how many days you would need to run the experiment. (These should be the answers from the \"Choosing Duration and Exposure\" quiz.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Give your reasoning for the fraction you chose to divert. How risky do you think this experiment would be for Udacity?\n"

    "## Experiment Analysis\n",
    "### Sanity Checks\n",
    "\n",
    "For each of your invariant metrics, give the 95% confidence interval for the value you expect to observe, the actual observed value, and whether the metric passes your sanity check. (These should be the answers from the \"Sanity Checks\" quiz.)\n",
    "\n",
    "For any sanity check that did not pass, explain your best guess as to what went wrong based on the day-by-day data. Do not proceed to the rest of the analysis unless all sanity checks pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Result Analysis\n",
    "#### Effect Size Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "For each of your evaluation metrics, give a 95% confidence interval around the difference between the experiment and control groups. Indicate whether each metric is statistically and practically significant. (These should be the answers from the \"Effect Size Tests\" quiz.)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sign Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "For each of your evaluation metrics, do a sign test using the day-by-day data, and report the p-value of the sign test and whether the result is statistically significant. (These should be the answers from the \"Sign Tests\" quiz.)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "State whether you used the Bonferroni correction, and explain why or why not. If there are any discrepancies between the effect size hypothesis tests and the sign tests, describe the discrepancy and why you think it arose.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendation\n",
    "\n",
    "Make a recommendation and briefly describe your reasoning."
